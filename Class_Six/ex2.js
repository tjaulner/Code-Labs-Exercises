//Aim: Write a function that returns an array containing all the numbers inclusive to that range given the start and end values. 
//See examples on page


//Notes
//The resulting array's sort order is dependent on the input values.
//All inputs provided in the test scenarios are valid.
//If the start is greater than the end, return a descendingly sorted array; 
        //otherwise, ascendingly sorted.
