Terminal Commands:
Node check
    node -v

NPM check
    npm -v

npm init -y
    this will create a package.json file

I already installed typescript globally, skipped over that part
    something about npm install typescript --save-dev
        this is not a glboal save, but local to folder/project
If saved locally, need to update the package.json file - in angular, this will not be needed:
            Per Zelda:  Under package.json, just be sure to include this:

"devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "4.8.3 {or your version of typescript}"
  }


Other Commands:
to compile:

tsc filename.ts 
^^ since I downloaded this globally, no need to add npx before tsc
