Angular 1 vs Angular 2
    Ang 1 is "AngularJS" - not really used anylonger 
    Ang 2 + plus are all based on Angular 2
        THese are just referred to as "Angular"

working on first project called "my-first-app"
had some issues with NPM, node and hten angular ci versions, had to update all to
get this to work
