Switching gears from initial lesson plan? "Break" day

Intro - watch and learn. Don't fret on 100% understanding.

TOpic One - Async & Await
-- Went over API stuff.  Old way (promises) and new (async/await)
-- Key words:  fetch, then, catch, await 

Topic Two:  Class
-- MOre in depth when we get to angular 
-- In Angular, we build objects using classes 
Constructor - a method that runs when class is initiated
In angular, these classes are referred to as "components"?

Topic Three:  Spread vs Rest
- Rest operator allows for multiple inputs into a function
argument is ...args (or whatever var you want, key thing is the three ...) 
    data passed into function are then sorted in an array

- Spread operator 
    also uses the ...
    - In teh example allows for addition/combo of two array sets into one 
    - spread operator allows us to work wtih the items in the arrays
        So, adding in items from the array(s) and placing into a single array
